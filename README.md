git-rank

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mmrobins/git-rank.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mmrobins/git-rank)

Use to rank contributors to a git project by lines of conribution.  This can be
done by blame lines for a current view of the project, or by log for a
historical view.  Includes options for breakdown by file, excluding authors and
files and filtering lines by regex.

# Installation

The easiest way to install is to generate the standalone script and copy to
somewhere in your PATH like ~/bin.

    rake bundle &> /dev/null && cp git-rank $HOME/bin

If you would like to run from source to make updates from git easier, symlink
the bin/git-rank file to somewhere in your path and add git-rank/lib to your
RUBYLIB to run from source.  This way if you update this repo, no further
action is required to run the new code.

    ln -s `pwd`/bin/git-rank $HOME/bin/git-rank && export RUBYLIB=`pwd`/lib:$RUBYLIB

Or you can build it as a gem yourself.  This is probably not recommended unless
you're happy with the current functionality or are uncomfortable with modifying
your PATH and RUBYLIB.  I'm not sure that shipping this as a gem is the right
way to distribute it long term, as I'm guessing there may be a better way to
add commands to git.  If you want the gem:

    gem build git-rank.gemspec && gem install git-rank-0.0.1.gem

# Usage

See `git-rank --help` for usage info.  Note although most of the time you can
use `git rank` without the dash to run the command, when asking for help you
need the dash otherwise git tries to use the core code to look up help.
