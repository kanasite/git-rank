git-rank

Use to rank contributors to a git project by lines of conribution.  This can be
done by blame lines for a current view of the project, or by log for a
historical view.  Includes options for breakdown by file, excluding authors and
files and filtering lines by regex.

# Installation

For now copy the git-rank file to somewhere in your path and add git-rank/lib
to your RUBYLIB to run from source.  If I get around to it or anyone cares I
may take the time to get it installable as a gem, but I'm wondering if there's
a more common way to extend git.

# Usage

See `git rank --help` for usage info
